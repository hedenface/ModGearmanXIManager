# ModGearmanXIManager
Nagios XI Component for managing ModGearman installations

## Overview
This is a component used to manage a variety of ModGearman Servers/Workers, possibly running different versions of ModGearman, from a central location - within the Nagios XI interface. 

ModGearman XI Manager is a fork of an earlier work, ModGearman Manager (https://exchange.nagios.org/directory/Addons/Components/ModGearman-Manager/details).

## How to Use
1. Download the ZIP file (https://github.com/hedenface/ModGearmanXIManager/releases/download/1.0.3/modgearmanxi.zip)
2. Upload it to your Nagios XI instance (Admin -> Manage Components -> Upload)
3. Run the included setup.sh file, which sets up necessary permissions on the workers
4. Update the $gearmanxi_cfg array in modgearmanxi.php to reflect your environment
5. Click on Admin -> ModGearman XI Manager and enjoy managing your ModGearman instances!
